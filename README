Installation :

- First you need to install dependencies by (example for Debian based distro):
	sudo apt-get install python-mutagen python-notify

- Then to get the latest version of the plugin, do :
	mkdir ~/.local/share/rhythmbox/plugins/ (if your plugin directory does not exists)
	cd ~/.local/share/rhythmbox/plugins/
	git clone git://github.com/masterbox/saveTAGRating
	
Installation done !

Usage :
- first backup ~/.local/share/rhythmbox/rhythmdb.xml and your audio files in case something goes wrong

- To save rhythmbox database ratings and playcounts to files tag do :
right click on a selection of files (mp3,ogg,oga,flac) > save ratings and counts to file
(it will erase any previous stored ratings and playcounts tags)

- To restore rhythmbox database ratings and playcounts from files tag do :
right click on a selection of files (mp3,ogg,oga,flac) > restore ratings and counts from file
(it will erase rhythmbox database values unless the value from the file are 0)

Git repo usage :
- create a local .gitignore and put the following lines :

*.pyc
.*
*~
to ignore hidden files, backup files and .pyc files



Todo :
- FMPS_PLAYCOUNT for TXXX tag for mp3
- Support APEv2
- Progress bar during file processing
- New entry to synchronize between rhythmbox database and files (in a smart way, for example always set max(filecount,dbcount) for the playcount tag)
- internationalization



Idea :
- use dbus to save the tag each time a rating is changed or each time a file has been played
