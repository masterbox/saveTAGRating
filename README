Usage :
- first backup ~/.local/share/rhythmbox/rhythmdb.xml and your audio files in case something goes wrong
- To save rhythmbox database ratings and playcounts to files tag do :
right click on mp3 files > save ratings and counts to file
(it will erase any previous stored ratings and playcounts tags)
- To restore rhythmbox database ratings and playcounts from files tag do :
right click on mp3 files > restore ratings and counts from file
(it will erase rhythmbox database values)

Git repo usage :
- create a local .gitignore and put the following lines :

*.pyc
.*
*~
to ignore hidden files, backup files and .pyc files



Todo :
- support xiph comments to store ratings/playcounts inside ogg vorbis and flac files
- new entry to synchronize between rhythmbox database and files (in smart way, for example always set max(filecount,dbcount) for the playcount tag)
- internationalization
- menu icons
- use gui threads to avoid ui locking 


Idea :
- use dbus to save the tag each time a rating is changed or each time a file has been played
